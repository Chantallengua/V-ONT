# V-ONT

<p>
  V-ONT is the end-of-course project for "Knowledge Representation and Extraction" (prof.Gangemi) within the Master of "Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge" (University of Bologna - Alma Mater Studiorum).
</p>
<p>
In particular, it is the implementation of a topic modelling algorithm in Python on Van Goghâ€™s letters to infer and deduct strokes and characteristics of his paintings in an automatic and formal way thanks to ontologies, linked data, knowledge patterns.
